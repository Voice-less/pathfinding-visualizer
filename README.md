### [‚û°Ô∏è View the Live Demo Here ‚¨ÖÔ∏è](https://voice-less.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/)

This is an interactive web application for visualizing classic pathfinding algorithms. It provides a real-time, animated comparison of how algorithms like A*, Dijkstra's, and Breadth-First Search (BFS) explore a user-drawn maze to find the optimal path.

The entire application is built from the ground up with **pure, dependency-free JavaScript** and the **HTML5 Canvas API** for high-performance rendering.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Algorithm Comparison:** Visualize and compare **A\***, **Dijkstra's**, and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
*   **Interactive Maze Creation:** Draw your own custom walls or generate a complex maze with a single click.
*   **Real-Time Animation:** Watch the "mind" of each algorithm as it explores the grid, node by node, and then see the final shortest path drawn.
*   **Dynamic Controls:** Place and move the start and end nodes anywhere on the grid.
*   **Performance Stats:** Get instant feedback on the number of nodes visited, path length, and time taken for each algorithm run.

## üéÆ Controls

*   **Draw Walls:** Click and drag on the grid.
*   **Move Start Node:** **Shift + Click** a new location.
*   **Move End Node:** **Ctrl + Click** (or **Cmd + Click** on Mac) a new location.
*   **Run Visualization:** Select an algorithm from the dropdown and click "Visualize!".
